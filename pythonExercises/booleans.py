# Booleans

# There are only two booleans true or false

name = 'Jordan'
is_cool = False

is_cool = True

#Booleans represent the idea of true and false or in coding 1 and 0

# True = 1
#False = 0

# We are going to explore using booleans as conditional logic and using booleans to denote logic.

#so example below would equal true
print(bool(1))

#and this example would equal false
print(bool(0))

# in those two examples above we are just converting the integers into there boolean values
